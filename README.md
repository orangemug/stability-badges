# stability-badges
SVG badges for projects based on the [Node stability index](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index).


## Badges
Badges with node stability index descriptions slightly changed to remove the 'feature' references.


### Work in progress
![stability-wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-work_in_progress-lightgrey.svg)

This is a 'work in progress' and is not ready for use of any kind at this time.

### Deprecated
![stability-deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-deprecated-red.svg)

Changes are planned. Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings. Backwards compatibility should not be expected.

### Experimental
![stability-experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg)

This is new and may change or be removed in future versions. Please try it out and provide feedback. If it addresses a use-case that is important to you, tell the node core team.

### Unstable
![stability-unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-yellow.svg)

The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable.

### Stable
![stability-stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg)

The API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying code may cause minor changes. Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.

### Frozen
![stability-frozen](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-frozen-brightgreen.svg)

This API has been tested extensively in production and is unlikely to ever have to change.

    ![stability-frozen](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-frozen-brightgreen.svg)

### Locked
![stability-frozen](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-locked-blue.svg)

Unless serious bugs are found, this code will not ever change.
